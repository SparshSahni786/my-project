Project Title:
Intelligent Chatbot with Search and History Management

Project Description:
This project is a full-stack web-based chatbot application that allows users to interact naturally, 
search information, and store chat history for future reference. The system is designed to provide an intelligent,
responsive, and user-friendly conversational experience while demonstrating the integration of frontend, backend, and 
database technologies.

The chatbot processes user inputs, performs real-time search operations (either from external APIs or predefined datasets),
and returns accurate responses. Each conversation is automatically stored in a database, allowing users to view, search, and
manage their past chats.

On the frontend, a clean and interactive UI built with React.js (or HTML/CSS/JavaScript) ensures smooth user experience.
The backend, developed using Node.js and Express.js (or Python Flask/Django), handles message processing, API communication,
and data storage logic. The database layer, powered by MongoDB/MySQL, stores chat histories, user sessions, and search results 
efficiently.

Key Features:
 -> Interactive Chat Interface: Real-time conversation between user and bot.
 -> Search Functionality: Retrieves relevant results based on user queries.
 -> History Management: Stores and displays previous chats for reference.
 -> Persistent Storage: Uses a database to store messages and user sessions.
 -> Real-time Updates: Dynamic communication using APIs or WebSockets.
 -> Responsive UI: Clean and modern design adaptable for all devices.
